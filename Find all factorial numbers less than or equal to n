A number n is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,
Given a number n, the task is to return the list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller than or equal to n.

Examples:

Input: n = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 1 which is less than equal to n. The second number is 2 which is less than equal to n,but the third factorial number is 6 which is greater than n. So we print only 1 and 2.

class Solution {tc O(n) sc O(1)
    static ArrayList<Long> factorialNumbers(long n) {
        // code here
        ArrayList<Long> li=new ArrayList<>();
        long ans=1;
        int i=1;
        while(ans<=n){
            li.add(ans);
            i++;
            ans=ans*i;
        }
        return li;
    }
}
