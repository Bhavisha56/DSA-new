Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.

Examples :

Input: k = 2, arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output: 5
Explanation: The array can be modified as {1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k} = {3, 3, 6, 8}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.



a+k---------------x+k,y-k-----------------------b-k


class Solution {
    int getMinDiff(int[] arr, int k) {
        // code here
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int n=arr.length;
        int small=arr[0]+k;
        int huge=arr[n-1]-k;
        int res=arr[n-1]-arr[0];
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
            int max=Math.max(huge,arr[i]+k);
            int min=Math.min(small,arr[i+1]-k);
            if(min<0){
                continue;
            }
            res=Math.min(res,max-min);
            
        }
        return res;
    }
}
