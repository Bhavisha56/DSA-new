Given two arrays a[] and b[], the task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays.

The Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one element occurrence should be there in the union.

Note: Elements of a[] and b[] are not necessarily distinct.

Examples

Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 5
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the elements which comes in the union setof both arrays. So count is 5.


brute approach: using set to store all element from a[] and b[] in set and return set size   tcO(n+m) sc O(n)

optimized appraoch : 

class Solution {
    public static int findUnion(int a[], int b[]) {
       ArrayList<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();

        // Add all elements from array a to res
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            res.add(a[i]);
        }

        // Traverse through b[] and search every element
        // b[i] in a[]
        for (int i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {

            // check if the element was present in a[]
            // to avoid duplicates
            int j;
            for (j = 0; j < a.length; j++) {
                if (a[j] == b[i])
                    break;
            }

            // If not already present, add it to res
            if (j == a.length) {
                res.add(b[i]);
            }
        }
           return res.size();
    }
}
